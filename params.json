{"name":"WHM","tagline":"Drupal 7 WHM integration module","body":"## WHM module for Drupal: WebHost Manager (WHM) Integration\r\n\r\n* Original Author: Joe Turgeon [http://arithmetric.com]\r\n* Current Author: Mikey O'Toole (http://mjco.ltd.uk)\r\n* Original Sponsorship: Sundays Energy [http://sundaysenergy.com]\r\n* Current Sponsorship: MJCO [http://mjco.ltd.uk]\r\n* Licensed under GPL v3\r\n\r\n## INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWebHost Manager (WHM) is a commercial server administration system\r\nthat manages hosted cPanel accounts. This module provides a user and\r\nprogram interface to some of WHM's reseller functions, enabling Drupal\r\nadministrators, authorized users, or other modules to list, create,\r\nand (un)suspend cPanel accounts.\r\n\r\nThis project is not authorized or supported by cPanel. For information\r\non the cPanel or WHM products, see:\r\nhttp://www.cpanel.net\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nDownload the latest release of this module from:\r\nhttp://drupal.org/project/whm or http://github.com/MikeyMJCO/WHM\r\n\r\nUncompress the archive in your modules directory (sites/all/modules or\r\nsites/[name]/modules).\r\n\r\nIn Drupal, go to the modules page (Site building >> Modules) and\r\nenable the WHM module listed under the Hosting category.\r\n\r\nTo use the module, it must be configured with a WHM host and reseller\r\naccount. Go to the module's settings form (Admin > WHM or example.com/admin/whm)\r\nand enter the hostname of your WHM server, the username for a reseller\r\naccount, and its remote access key. The remote access key is generated\r\nby WHM, and can be found under 'Setup Remote Access Key' in the WHM\r\ninterface. Note: In WHM, the reseller account must be granted specific\r\npermission to list, create, and suspend accounts.\r\n\r\n## FEATURES\r\n\r\nThis module enables three WHM functions through a user and programming\r\ninterface: listing, creating, and (un)suspending accounts managed by\r\nthe specified reseller. These functions are accessible to authorized \r\nusers through the Administer >> WHM menu.\r\n\r\nThe list accounts page displays the username, domain name, and hosting\r\nplan. Additionally, it allows accounts to be suspended or unsuspended.\r\nThe create account page allows a new account to be created with a\r\nspecified username, contact e-mail address, password, domain name, and\r\nhosting plan.\r\n\r\nUser access to these functions is limited by the permissions set in\r\nUser management >> Access control under the WHM module. Access can be\r\ngranted by function (to list accounts, to create a new account, or \r\nto (un)suspend accounts).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this module provides a direct programming interface to\r\nthese WHM functions. Note: There are no access restrictions to the\r\nfunctions, as it is expected that programs utilizing these functions\r\nwould implement their own permissions system.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
